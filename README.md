This repo documents my journey in learning moblie development using Flutter. All the little apps i develop will have a reference here.
What Is Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google.  Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications. We don't need to write separate code to build an app for Android and iOS instead Code will be written in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and that code will be compiled into native machine code using the Flutter SDK (Software Development Kit).

### Why Flutter 

With Flutter You can have a single codebase for all platform apps which helps developers in maintaining, debugging, and updating a codebase with ease. Flutter can be used to build an app for Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop with a single codebase). Also, the changes can be seen in the app within seconds when we make changes in the code with hot reload.
